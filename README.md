Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class.

Syntax: 

```
class  <derived_class_name> : <access-specifier> <base_class_name>
{
        //body
}
```

  - ```derived_class_name```: name of the new class, which will inherit the base class
  - ```access-specifier```: either of ```private```, ```public``` or ```protected```. If neither is specified, ```PRIVATE``` is taken as default
  - ```base-class-name```: name of the base class

    > Note: A derived class doesnâ€™t inherit access to private data members. However, it does inherit a full parent object, which contains any private members which that class declares.

Let's consider an example:

```cpp
class Animal {
protected:
    std::string name;
    int age;
public:
    Animal(const std::string& name, int age) : name(name), age(age) {}

    void eat() {
        std::cout << name << " is eating." << std::endl;
    }

    void sleep() {
        std::cout << name << " is sleeping." << std::endl;
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    Dog(const std::string& name, int age) : Animal(name, age) {}

    void bark() {
        std::cout << name << " is barking." << std::endl;
    }
};
```

- In this example, we have a base class `Animal` that defines common properties and behaviors for animals.
- It has a `name` and `age` member variables, as well as member functions `eat()` and `sleep()`.
- The derived class `Dog` inherits from the `Animal` class using the `public` access specifier. 
- This means that all public and protected members of the `Animal` class become part of the `Dog` class. 

As a result, an instance of the `Dog` class has access to the `name`, `age`, `eat()`, and `sleep()` members inherited from the `Animal` class.

The `Dog` class also introduces its own unique behavior with the `bark()` member function.

Now, let's see how inheritance is used in practice:

```cpp
int main() {
    Dog dog("Buddy", 3);
    dog.eat();   // Output: Buddy is eating.
    dog.sleep(); // Output: Buddy is sleeping.
    dog.bark();  // Output: Buddy is barking.

    return 0;
}
```

In the `main()` function, we create an instance of the `Dog` class named `dog` with the name "Buddy" and age 3. 

We can then call the member functions `eat()`, `sleep()`, and `bark()` on the `dog` object, which are inherited from the `Animal` class and defined in the `Dog` class.

It's important to note that there are different access specifiers (`public`, `protected`, and `private`) that control the visibility of inherited members in the derived class. 
  - The `public` specifier allows inherited members to be accessed by objects of the derived class and from outside the class.
  - The `protected` specifier allows inherited members to be accessed by objects of the derived class, but not from outside the class.
  - The `private` specifier hides inherited members from objects of the derived class and from outside the class.


# Class specifiers examples: 

In C++, class specifiers are used to define derived classes (also known as subclasses or child classes) that inherit from a base class (also known as a superclass or parent class).

The class specifiers determine the type of inheritance and access level between the derived and base classes. There are three access specifiers: `public`, `protected`, and `private`. Let's look at some examples to clarify the differences and understand when to use each one:

## Public Inheritance

  In public inheritance, all public members of the base class become public members of the derived class, and all protected members of the base class become protected members of the derived class. 
  Private members of the base class remain inaccessible to the derived class.

  ```cpp
  class Animal {
  public:
      void makeSound() {
          cout << "Animal makes a sound." << endl;
      }
  };
  
  class Dog : public Animal {
  public:
      void bark() {
          cout << "Dog barks." << endl;
      }
  };
  
  int main() {
      Dog dog;
      dog.makeSound(); // Accessible, as it's a public member of the base class.
      dog.bark();      // Accessible, as it's a member of the derived class.
      return 0;
  }
  ```

  Use public inheritance when you want to model an "is-a" relationship, meaning the derived class is a specialized version of the base class.

## Protected Inheritance:
  In protected inheritance, all public and protected members of the base class become protected members of the derived class. Private members of the base class remain inaccessible to the derived class.
  
  ```cpp
  class Person {
  public:
      void introduce() {
          cout << "Hi, I'm a person." << endl;
      }
  };
  
  class Student : protected Person {
  public:
      void learn() {
          cout << "Student is learning." << endl;
      }
  };
  
  int main() {
      Student student;
      student.introduce(); // Not accessible, as it's a protected member of the base class.
      student.learn();     // Accessible, as it's a member of the derived class.
      return 0;
  }
  ```
  
  Use protected inheritance when you want to restrict access to the base class's interface for the derived class but still want the derived class to inherit the functionality.

## Private Inheritance:

  In private inheritance, all public and protected members of the base class become private members of the derived class. Private members of the base class remain inaccessible to the derived class.
  
  ```cpp
  class Shape {
  public:
      void draw() {
          cout << "Drawing a shape." << endl;
      }
  };
  
  class Circle : private Shape {
  public:
      void drawCircle() {
          cout << "Drawing a circle." << endl;
          draw(); // Accessible since it's a private member of the derived class.
      }
  };
  
  int main() {
      Circle circle;
      circle.drawCircle(); // Accessible, as it's a member of the derived class.
      circle.draw();       // Not accessible, as it's a private member of the derived class.
      return 0;
  }
  ```
  
  Use private inheritance when you want to implement a "has-a" relationship, meaning the derived class has the functionality of the base class but is not a specialized version of it.

Public inheritance is the most common form of inheritance used in C++ for modeling hierarchical relationships, while protected and private inheritance are used more sparingly for specific situations like access control or component reuse. 

Always favor composition over inheritance when possible, as it often leads to more flexible and maintainable code.
